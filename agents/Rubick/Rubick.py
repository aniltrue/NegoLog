        **Rubick by Okan Tunalı**:
            Rubick Agent is a complex time-based conceder enriched by derivations of well studied heuristics in
            automated negotiation field. The main component of the agent is the target utility, which is actually
            lower boundary in the bid generation and in acceptance condition. If the history is not available yet,
            target utility is initialized as the utility of the first received bid and updated to the highest utility
            received from any of the opponent parties. On the other hand, if it detects a negotiation history with the
            same opponents, it sets the lower bound to be the highest utility ever received throughout the negotiation;
            thinking that the opponents will be designed in a myopic way. Both bid generation and acceptance strategies
            include randomness; they follow a *Boulware* strategy but the pace of concession is randomized. Technically,
            they sample from one-sided Gaussian distributions whose standard deviation increase over time, increasing
            the likelihood of sending bids close to lower boundary. The opponent model resolves the bids into issue
            evaluation values and considering their occurrence frequencies, searches forbids that holds the target
            utility requirements while having the most common values. That is, it employs a frequency-based opponent
            modeling. Finally, the model keeps a list of bids accepted by only one of the opponents in the previous
            negotiations, which is sorted according to the gained utility by the Rubick agent. Elements of this list
            is used in bid generation only if there is almost no time left. [Aydogan2021]_
