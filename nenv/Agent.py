class AbstractAgent(ABC):
    """
        Agents aim to reach a joint decision within a limited time through negotiation without fully revealing their
        preferences. During negotiation, agents must decide what to offer and when to accept the opponent's offer. To
        facilitate this process, this abstract class provides a framework for developing negotiating agents. Each agent
        must extend this abstract class to implement its specific negotiation strategy.

        **Components**:
            Negotiating agents can be formulated as consisting of three main components [BOAComponents]_.
                - **Bidding Strategy**:  Determines what to offer.
                - **Acceptance Strategy**: Decides when to accept the opponent's offer
                - **Opponent Model**: Estimates the preferences of the opponent.

            By extending this class, *bidding strategy* and *acceptance strategy* are implemented to develop an agent.
            To implement an opponent model, see also *AbstractOpponentModel* class.

        **Methods**:
            To extend this abstract class, following methods must be implemented.
                - **initiate**: Use this method to initialize required variables instead of the constructor.
                - **name**: Each agent must have a unique name for logging purposes.
                - **receive_offer**: This method is called when an offer is received. Generally, the opponent model can be updated in this method.
                - **act**: This method determines the action that the agent takes. It should include the *bidding strategy* and *acceptance strategy*.
                - **terminate**: This method is called at the end of the negotiation session.

            - **Making offer**: You should return an **Offer** object such as: *nenv.Offer(bid)*
